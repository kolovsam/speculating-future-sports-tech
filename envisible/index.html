                Anne's is a basketball student-athlete who is struggling to balance getting enough
                sleep with studying enough for her exams. Thanks to EnVisible, a data tracking and
                sharing platform that gives athlete control over who their data is shared with, Anne
                is able to see how her lack of sleep is affecting her performance. 
                While she has opted to not to share this data with her coach, some
                of her teammates have opted to sleep more and share their data
                with their coach so that their coach knows they are prepared to perform. After making
                the starting lineup for a game, Anne performs badly and must decide what to do to
                keep her position on the team.

            <h4>EnVisible Team's Envisioned Future</h4>
            <p>
                Our envisioned future is one where college athletes have 100% privacy and autonomy
                in choosing to share their data with teammates and coaches. Athletes use tracked
                data to make informed decisions. However, we wonder...is 100% privacy is truly
                beneficial for athletes? Do student-athletes have the freedom not to share their data?

                <h4>What is EnVisible?</h4>
                <p>
                    EnVisible is a team performance tracking system that helps athletes and coaches
                    monitor performance and recovery. Athletes are equipped with a data visualizer
                    and voice operated system that helps them see their own data and compare it to
                    their teammates. Through this system they are also able to control who their
                    data is shared with and what data streams will be shared automatically or not. 
                    Coaches have a similar set up for viewing any data the athletes choose to share.
                    Both athletes and coaches also have one or more small round devices that are 
                    able to collect and transmit various types of data.
